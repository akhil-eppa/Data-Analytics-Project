# Data-Analytics-Project
This is the official repository for our assignment submissions/project for Data Analytics Course 2020.

# Repository Contents:
1. ```Dataset```
     - This folder contains the dataset which we used for our project.
     - This dataset is exactly the same as the one available on the [Kaggle competition's website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data)
2. ```Kaggle Notebooks```
      - This folder contains the different ```.ipynb``` files we created and worked on as part of this project
      - We created and worked on our project's ```.ipynb``` files on Kaggle
3. ```EDA_Summary```
      - This folder contains the features and points we observed about the data we notices while performing the process of Exploratory Data Analysis
4. ```Literature_Survey```
      - This folder contains the files we used and created during the literature survey we performed in the early stages of the project
          * ```Papers```: This folder contains the papers we surveryed and reviewed
          * ```Summaries```: This folder contains the summaries 
5. ```Guidelines```
      - This folder contains the updated guidelines document

# How to reproduce our Results?
  1. Follow the links below to run the notebooks on **Kaggle**:
     - The Kaggle links contain the same notebooks and the dataset files as in this repository along with the correct paths set and the execution outputs visible
     - These notebooks may take some time (i.e. ~1 hour each) to complete execution due to the large dataset size, model training time as well as the many data preprocessing steps
          * Therefore to review the notebooks' results faster, the output of the notebooks' cells (*from the immediate previous execution of the notebook, which we have already performed*) are visible when viewing the notebooks on Kaggle
     1. Notebooks for final Submission:
          - [Data Preprocessing, Final XGBoost-Regressor model](https://www.kaggle.com/rishitchs/data-preprocessing-and-xgboost-regressor-model)
          - [Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization, Linear Regression, DTree Regressor, RandomForest](https://www.kaggle.com/futurestan/visualization-linreg-dtree-randomforest)
     2. [Notebook and its multiple versions we worked on during the course of the project, experimenting with different models and techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/rishitchs/data-preprocessing-and-xgboost-regressor-model-old)
